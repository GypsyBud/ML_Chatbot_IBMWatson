# ML_Chatbot_IBMWatson
IBM Watson Chatbot which uses machine learning algorithms to process NLP

Using IBM Watson Speech to Text SDK, this code is used simply for the hackathon and serves no real purpose other than experimentation. 
Feel free to use this code to process natural language. Refer to the IBM Watson SDK docs on how to properly set up.

Also, many thanks to IBM for providing the Watson SDK for android.
